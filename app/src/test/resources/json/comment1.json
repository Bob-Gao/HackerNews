  "text" : "2 ways to deal with procrastination:<p>1. Don&#x27;t worry about it. We all procrastinate and most of the time it works out OK. Our instincts know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>2. Break tough tasks down into very, very laughably small tasks. Don&#x27;t even worry about doing them. Once the first task in the list is small enough you&#x27;ll think &quot;sod it&quot; and do it right away.<p>If you try to improve your self control you will fail. Go with the grain -- either stop worrying, or find a chunk of the task so is tiny and easy that it becomes instantly gratifying to do it.",
