For example, I&#x27;ll often procrastinate with anything to do with taxes because, even though I know I HAVE to pay it on an intellectual level, it&#x27;s emotionally difficult for me to part with money.<p>Often when I&#x27;ve rationally examined the underlying anxiety it becomes much easier to accomplish things.",
